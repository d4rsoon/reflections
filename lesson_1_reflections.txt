What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: its my choice, and I know what was changed in that commit.
Cons: I can forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It depends on purpose of version control system. Google Docs is dedicated for  documents like xls and doc, which are generally used as single documents. Git is dedicated for programming purposes, where we work on group of files and folders.
