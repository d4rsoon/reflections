When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work on more than 1 computer or want to share my project with other contributors

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are like clons but they exist only at github. Clones are copies of repository on local drive. Branches are within repository.
